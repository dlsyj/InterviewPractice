/* We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from 1 to n. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I'll tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.

However, when you guess a particular number x, and you guess wrong, you pay $x. You win the game when you guess the number I picked.

Example:

n = 10, I pick 8.

First round:  You guess 5, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $5.
Second round: You guess 7, I tell you that it's higher. You pay $7.
Third round:  You guess 9, I tell you that it's lower. You pay $9.

Game over. 8 is the number I picked.

You end up paying $5 + $7 + $9 = $21.
Given a particular n â‰¥ 1, find out how much money you need to have to guarantee a win
 * Method:
For each number x in range[i~j]
we do: result_when_pick_x = x + max{DP([i~x-1]), DP([x+1, j])}
--> // the max means whenever you choose a number, the feedback is always bad and therefore leads you to a worse branch.
then we get DP([i~j]) = min{xi, ... ,xj}
--> // this min makes sure that you are minimizing your cost.
